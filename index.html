        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I'm Tyson, always learning and growing. I recently got certified in Data Analytics and I'm now working on getting an AAS degree in both Information Technology and Data Analytics to boost my skills. I love playing tabletop role-playing games and Magic The Gathering with friends. I also enjoy crafting and painting figurines, making characters come to life. I'm good at things like parking, driving manual cars, and building computers from scratch. With 14 years at Amazon and my current job coordinating logistics, I'm great at solving problems and communicating well. As Yoda says, "Do or do not, there is no try." I'm excited to keep growing and connecting with others who share my interests.</p>
